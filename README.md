Kafka Course Task
The Kafka repository contains Python scripts that facilitate message consumption and processing using Kafka. Here's a breakdown of the files:

Consumer_BW.py: Implements a Kafka consumer that processes incoming messages from Kafka topics, likely related to image data based on the project context.
consumer_server_upload.py: Handles the integration between Kafka and a server, uploading processed data.
server.py: Manages server-side operations, interacting with Kafka consumers to handle real-time data streaming.
This repository is a part of a larger project focused on real-time data processing using Kafka
